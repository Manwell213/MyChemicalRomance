            <p><strong>My Chemical Romance</strong> (often abbreviated as MCR) was an American rock
                band from New Jersey, formed in 2001. The band consisted of lead vocalist
                Gerard Way, guitarists Ray Toro and Frank Iero, bassist Mikey Way and 
                keyboardist James Dewees. Shortly after forming, the band signed to Eyeball
                Records and released their debut album I Brought You My Bullets, You 
                Brought Me Your Love in 2002. They signed with Reprise Records the next
                year and released their major label debut Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge in 2004; the album was a commercial success, and was awarded platinum
                status a little over a year later
                <br>
                <br>
                The band eclipsed their previous success with their 2006 concept album, The Black Parade, which gained generally favorable reviews among music critics. Their fourth studio album, Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, was released on November 22, 2010, to positive reviews. The band's final release was a series of singles, released over the course of five months, collected on the compilation Conventional Weapons. The band announced its break-up on March 22, 2013, one month after the final release in the Conventional Weapons series. A greatest hits collection entitled May Death Never Stop You was released on March 25, 2014.

                My Chemical Romance was formed in 2001 by Gerard Way, who was inspired to start a band after witnessing the 9/11 attacks. The initial lineup included Gerard Way (vocals), Ray Toro (lead guitar), Matt Pelissier (drums), and Mikey Way (bass), with Frank Iero joining later as the rhythm guitarist.<br><br>The album was recorded at Nada Recording Studio in New Windsor, New York, with producer John Naclerio.

            <img src="tcfsr.jpg" class="img2">
            <p>
                In 2003, the band signed a deal with Reprise Records. Following a tour with Avenged Sevenfold, the band began working on their second album, entitled Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge.
                <br><br>
                The album is a loose concept album about a man and a woman who die in a gunfight. The man ends up in purgatory and is told he can be reunited with his lover if he brings the Devil the souls of 1,000 evil men. Themes of loss, revenge, and love permeate the album, giving it a dark and theatrical tone.

            <h2>The Black Parade (2006-2008)</h2>
            <p>
                My Chemical Romance started recording their third studio album on April 10, 2006 with Rob Cavallo, producer of many of Green Day's albums. It was originally thought to be titled The Rise and Fall of My Chemical Romance (in reference to The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars by David Bowie), but in an interview with Kerrang! magazine, Gerard Way suggested this was just the album's working title, stating "It was never the title of the album, more a spoof, or joke."

                <img src="Blackparadecover.jpg" class="img6">
                "The Black Parade" is a rock opera that tells the story of a character known as "The Patient," who is dying of cancer. The Death comes to him in the form of parade because the band thinks that death appears to a person in a form of a person's most beloved recollection of a past experience, which in this case is seeing a marching band as a child.
The album explores his experiences with death, the afterlife, and reflections on his life.

                    In 2009, My Chemical Romance released a new single entitled "Desolation Row" (a cover of the Bob Dylan song) on February 1, 2009. It was recorded to feature as the end credit track for the 2009 film Watchmen, an adaptation of the graphic novel of the same name.

                On July 31 and August 1, 2009, My Chemical Romance played two "secret" shows at The Roxy Theater in Los Angeles. The shows were the first concerts the band had played since Madison Square Garden in May 2008. The band also premiered several new songs said to be from their upcoming fourth album during the shows, one reportedly titled "Death Before Disco", a song that Way said he was particularly excited about. The song was since renamed "Party Poison" and was included on the new album.
                <br><br><br>
                On March 3, 2010, Iero announced on their official website that Bob Bryar had left the band, writing: "As of 4 weeks ago, My Chemical Romance and Bob Bryar parted ways. This was a painful decision for all of us to make and was not taken lightly."
                <br><br>
                The band did not state reasons on why he left.

                In September, a trailer video was uploaded to My Chemical Romance's official YouTube page entitled Art is a Weapon, which announced the title of the album: Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys. The video featured the band wearing strangely coloured outfits and battling unusual characters in a desert surrounding, and featuring a sample of music from the song "Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na)".
                <br><br><br>
                
                Michael Pedicone joined the band as a touring drummer late in 2010, replacing Bryar.
                <br><br><br>
                <strong>PS: I personally did not liked the transition they did. It also has been rumored that Bryar left because of the same reason.</strong>

                "Conventional Weapons" is a compilation album consisting of ten previously unreleased tracks recorded in 2009, before the band worked on "Danger Days." These songs were initially shelved as the band decided to take a different direction with "Danger Days."
                <br><br><br>
                The album was released in a unique format, with two songs released every month over five months, making it a staggered and engaging experience for fans.<br><br><br>

                On September 2, 2011, Frank Iero posted a blog on the band's site stating, "The relationship between My Chemical Romance and Michael Pedicone is over" and explaining Pedicone was sacked because "he was caught red handed stealing from the band and confessed to police after our show last night in Auburn, Washington." He also mentioned his hope of getting a new drummer in time for their next show and avoiding having to cancel any performances in the process.

                For over a year after the break up of My Chemical Romance, Way remained without a band until he formed Electric Century with Sleep Station vocalist David Debiak. The duo released their first song "I Lied" in February 2014. The same month, Electric Century was included in Alternative Press's "100 Bands You Need To Know" list. The magazine mentioned that "I Lied" "forges an alloy of decades-proven electronic pop" comparing it to fun. and Twenty One Pilots. Alternative Press also said that the duo's album was finished and awaiting release later that year. The album was recorded and mixed by D. James Goodwin at The Isokon Studio in Woodstock, New York. In November, Way revealed that he had flown in February to the East Coast to complete the album but instead went to rehab.

                <h2>My Top 10 Songs from My Chemical Romance</h2>
                <h3>1. Cancer</h3>
                <p>This track takes the top spot because everyone can relate to it easily. The pain of losing someone and knowing that they're time on earth is nearing is what makes people relate to it easily. Everytime I look at Hospitals, this is the song that comes to my mind.</p>

                <h3>2. I'm not Okay (I Promise)</h3>
                <p>This song became the emo classic/anthem because most emos are <em>not okay</em> or lets just say depressed and hated by society. But the main theme of this track is teenage angst, insecurity, and the struggles of adolescence. The music setting is also in high school portraying the theme.  </p>

                <h3>3. Disenchanted</h3>
                <p>This track is about "The Patient," who looks back on their life and confronts feelings of regret and unfulfilled expectations. This track makes me want to work hard and reach for my dreams, because i don't want to be on my death bed questioning myself if I lived my life to the fullest. I don't want my memories flashing before me and hating the ending like the song said.</p>

                <h3>4. I Don't Love You</h3>
                <p>Every easy to understand track. It talks about a love that has not been reciprocated well or not reciprocated at all. A love that faded / fading just as the lyrics said "I Don't love you like I did yesterday"</p>

                <h3>5. Helena</h3>
                <p>This track was one of the first songs that takes they're career to mainstream. The first 16 seconds of Gerard whispering voices, the song will slap you with addictive drum and guitar chords. Then the catchy repetitive lyrics come in that is so fun to scream "So long and goodnight"</p>

                <h3>6. Welcome to the Black Parade</h3>
                <p>This track is they're most popular song and it deserved that spot because of how they make different music genres complement each other and the storytelling of the lyrics. The first one minute with just piano, snare, and xylophone clearly is a good opener. Added to that is the catchy repetitive lyrics "We'll carry on" which means that even if you die, people around you will still remember you in their heart and in their memory. It also mean something about the storytelling because it talks about afterlife, you will carry on even after you're death.</p>

                <h3>7. The Ghost of you</h3>
                <p>The entire album talks about losing someone but this one takes my heart(also Helena). The feeling of grief and longing partnered with the lyrics "Never Coming Home". Added to that is the Music Video which takes place in WWII and inline with the meaning of the song.</p>

                <h3>8. Desert Song</h3>
                <p>This song talks about their struggles as a band, Gerard's depression, suicidal tendencies, and chemical dependence. Added to that, the sound of the Gerard's voice is raw and said that recorded the song drunk.<br>PS: It takes a very despressed person to write a very depressing song.</p>

                <h3>9. The Light Behind Your Eyes</h3>
                <p>This song is very emotional for me, and for the artist. "Never let them take the light behind your eyes" never let the depression ruin you and take over your life. Just as the band fights different emotional distress, they are also encouraging their fans to do the same.</p>

                <h3>10. Teenagers</h3>
                <p>The track portrays the societal perception of teenagers as a threat and the ways in which society tries to control and conform them. Gerard said that the first time he felt old was when he run by some teenagers and felt intimidated.
